## Description

This experimental clockface allows you to set custom day-start and day-end times in the settings, in order to have a visual representation of how far along you are in *your own* day. 

Say, you usually wake up at 22h30 and go to bed at 06h00. That's your day-time. Conversely, from 06h01 to 22h29 will be your night-time. Night-time is displayed in purple. Day-time is displayed in gray and red.

The clock hand will hit the 12 o'clock position at 22h30 and again at 06h00.

During the day-time (22h30 - 06h00), the hand will hit the 6 o'clock position when it's actually 02h15. At this point, half of _your day_ has passed.

During the night-time (06h01 - 22h29), the hand will hit the 6 o'clock position when it's actually 14h15. At this point, half of _your night_ has passed.

In the settings, you can hide any of the elements that you don't like, except for the rings.

___Tip__: If you like the interface but want to use it as a 'regular' clock, just set the day-start time for 12h00 and day-end time for 00h00. AM will be purple, PM will be red. This will be the initial configuration._
